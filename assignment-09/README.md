13. The difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types comes down to the elements that they will select. The universal selector will apply to every element on the page. This is good for setting up font styles that will be inherited throughout the page. The element selector will apply to all elements of a certain type, such as H2 for headings. This is good for setting up the styles for general paragraphs or headings. The class selector will apply to all elements that serve the same function. I would use this style for styling multiple divs that need the same attributes, such as their size on the page. The ID selector will define styles for a specific element with an ID. This is good for selecting individual divs, for specific colors, like I did on my site.

14. My color palette actually included 4 colors. I started with 3, but then needed a background color as well:

  Sinopia: rgb(207, 73, 22) or #CF4917

  Yellow Orange: rgb(249, 172, 61) or #F9AC3D

  Olive Drab 3: rgb(117, 140, 51) or #758C33

  Teal Blue: rgb(45, 117, 140) or #2D758C

  I started off by Googling 60s colors and stumbled upon the first color, sinopia. From there, I used Coolors.co to help me find a matching palette. With the images I found, I felt that the yellows, blues, and oranges seemed to create a theme throughout the GIFs, so I went with those colors. These four colors represent the groovy side of the 60s.

15. For my work cycle for this assignment, I started off with the HTML side. I added my essential elements and my meta before anything. I decided on 60s dancing after searching for some GIFs in Google and it became my theme. I updated my meta elements for this information. Next, I thought it would be cool to do a sort of simple GIF website. I divided into divs for each GIF and added the image elements in. Lastly, I added the copyright text, because I just needed some text on the page. I then went into the CSS file. I started more general and then went more specific. I did center align and added padding so it wouldn't look so cluttered. I gave myself a nice background color and then styled my paragraph to look sleek. I added my background colors to each of the divs by using the id selectors. I did some size styling in these, but then went and added a class to them to make it less redundant. Lastly, I added some image styling to the gifs to try to make them look better. Overall, the biggest problem that I had was choosing the colors. I'm not too good at design and whatnot, so learning colors will be a fun challenge for me. Also, adding the margin attribute to center my divs was interesting. I had to Google that to find that out. Other than that, this was fun!
