      <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
      <p><br />They're playing our song.<br />They're playing our song.<br />Can you see the lights?</br>Can you hear the hum of our song?<br /><br />
      I hope they get it right<br />I hope we dance tonight<br />before we get it wrong<br /><br />
      And the seasons<br />will change us new<br />but you're the best I've known<br />and you know me,<br />I could not be stuck on you<br />if it weren't true<br /><br />
      I was swimming.<br />My eyes were dark<br />til you woke me<br />and told me that opening<br />was just the start.<br />It was.<br /><br />
      Now I see you, till kingdom come<br />you're the one I want<br />to see me for all<br />the stupid shit I've done.<br /><br />
      Soil and six feet under,<br />kept just like we were<br />before you knew you'd know me<br />Now you know me.<br /><br />
      Blooming up from the group,<br />3 rounds and a sound,<br />like whispering, you know me.<br />You know me.<br /><br />
      So this was our song.<br />This was our song.<br />I still see the lights.<br />I can see them.<br /><br />
      And the crisscross<br />of what is true won't get to us<br />cause you know me<br />I could not give up on you...<br />wouldn't feel true.<br /><br />
      And the fog of<br />what is right<br />won't cover us<br />cause you know me<br />I could not give up a fight...<br />wouldn't feel right.<br /><br />
      Soil and six feet under,<br />kept just like we were<br />before you knew you'd know me.<br />Now you know me.<br /><br />
      Blooming up from the ground,<br />3 rounds and a sound,<br />like whispering you know me.<br />You know me.<br /><br /></p>
