      <p>Birchbark Candle Co. is the idea of Jordan Lyman. Jordan was born and raised in Moscow, Idaho,
        but moved to Missoula, Montana in 2015 to go to the University of Montana, where he persued a degree
        in biology. While at the university, he really wanted to learn a hobby, moving around from trade to
        trade until he found candlemaking. He watched this very same CandleScience video to learn how to
        make his first candle.
        <br />
        <br />
        After creating his first candle with this video, Jordan was hooked and started making dozens of candles,
        with various scents. He tirelessly tried endless combinations to find the best sizes, concoctions, and scents
        to sell in his candles. Though Birchbark Candle Co. has been on hiatus for the last few months due to the Corona
        Virus, we are starting production back up again!
        <br />
        <br />
        Founded in 2019, Birchbark Candle Co. makes 100% soy wax candles. They are all handpoured and carefully
         mixed in order to create a beautiful scent throw. Currently, there isn't a retail location to purchase
         a Birchbark Candle, but we may be expanding into the farmer's market circuit soon! Keep an eye out
         to see if we are sold near you!
