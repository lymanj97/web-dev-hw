      <p>I love how you never find their bodies, how they never rest their eyes. I love how their breasts are<br />
        comforters unfolding by their breath. I love that pigeons live in the city, that underestimation never<br />
        stopped a pigeon from unlatching itself or being old. I want them all unspooling in the air, and<br />
        bridges that are half sigh and half pigeon. I want to harbor their coo and utilize it for energy. I want<br />
        to learn to use them the way they want to be used. I want to pigeontail into a quiet night, to let<br />
        their oddness sit in our hands. You can never know a language until you quiet your own. I want<br />
        people to write about them. Their leaving ships for land, or standing on their own on a marble<br />
        statue in the shimmer of a field. I want to talk about the term <em>rock dove</em>, argue over whether or not<br />
        it's imperialist. I want the media to implicate us in the pigeon problem, for a couple to sit with<br />
        their asparagus and kids and realize none of this is far from them, whatever we think. I want oils<br />
        and watercolors and inks. I want still life with pigeons, since not a one has ever been portrayed with<br />
        a soul: a flight of them around old bread. And how they're all the same. How all the world is here<br />
        with them in hate, since they are rats adorned with angel wings, and the children down the street<br />
        are free to chase their drag: they want to see a pigeon's rouge entirely. Let the pigeon have her<br />
        pigment. Consider the pigeon's brown and green and everything, the brandishing of his nakedness<br />
        to the sun, as if nothing is absolute. I love the pigeons' shoulders, tongues, and wedding nights. I<br />
        love the pigeon's place in history, their obsession with living in the letters of our signs. I love their<br />
        minds, or what I've come to believe is their theology. Who knows? Let the pigeons speak. Ask the<br />
        closest pigeon for his number, for her middle name, if they are ready to die, if the sky gets crowded<br />
        enough to consider war, if their stores are closed on Sundays. I want to be ready for them to be just<br />
        like us, but more ready for them to be completely different. I don't want to waste any time tracing<br />
        a pigeon's god to Abraham. I want to get started. Some of us feed pigeons. I love, sometimes, our<br />
        care. I love, I think, the park bench. I love apples, but I do not love pears. The weather. I love the<br />
        pigeons, the revolution of wheel to sky. I love the newspaper graying in a different air.</p>
